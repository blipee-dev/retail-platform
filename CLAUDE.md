## Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (automatic deployments)
- **Sensors**: Milesight API integration (primary), Omnia (secondary)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Testing**: pytest (Python), Jest (JavaScript)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Vercel

## Important Files to Know

1. **`src/connector_system/base_connector.py`** - Abstract base class for all connectors
2. **`src/connector_system/milesight_connector.py`** - Main Milesight integration
3. **`config/sensors/milesight_*.json`** - Sensor configuration files
4. **`tests/connectors/test_milesight_connector.py`** - Main test coverage
5. **`.env.example`** - Environment variables template

## Common Tasks

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Testing a Connector
```bash
python tests/connectors/test_connector.py
```

### Running Analysis Scripts
```bash
python scripts/analysis/comprehensive_analysis.py
```

## Current Issues & Priorities

1. **Browser Networking in Codespaces**: Direct Supabase database queries timeout in browser environment. Implemented server-side API pattern as workaround.
2. **Real-time Data**: Need to implement WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
3. **Sensor Integration**: Python connectors need to be connected to Next.js API endpoints
4. **Production Deployment**: Ready for production deployment to main branch

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- Prefer configuration files over hardcoded values
- All new features need corresponding tests

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new connectors
- Use mock data for API testing (see test files for examples)
- Integration tests should use the mock HTTP server pattern
- Keep test files organized by type

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure Milesight credentials
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if exists)
4. Run tests to verify setup

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Lint and typecheck (when implemented)
npm run lint
npm run typecheck

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/connectors/test_milesight_connector.py -v

# Run analysis
python scripts/analysis/analyze_customer_pathways.py
```

## Architecture Notes

- The system is designed to be modular with pluggable connectors
- Each sensor type has its own connector inheriting from BaseConnector
- Configuration is JSON-based for easy modification
- Frontend and backend are currently separate (not fully integrated)

## Deployment Information

### Environments
- **Production**: Deploy to main branch â†’ https://retail-platform-blipee.vercel.app
- **Staging**: Deploy to staging branch â†’ https://retail-platform-git-staging-blipee.vercel.app  
- **Development**: Deploy to develop branch â†’ https://retail-platform-git-develop-blipee.vercel.app

### Environment Variables
- Use `scripts/env-manager.sh` to manage Vercel environment variables
- Environment files: `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`
- Supabase credentials are configured in all environments

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Push environment variables to Vercel
./scripts/env-manager.sh push staging
./scripts/env-manager.sh push production

# Deploy to specific environment
git push origin staging  # Auto-deploys to staging
git push origin develop  # Auto-deploys to development
git push origin main     # Auto-deploys to production
```

## Internationalization (i18n) Guidelines

### Supported Languages
- **English (en)** - Default language
- **Portuguese (pt)** - European Portuguese  
- **Spanish (es)** - Latin American Spanish

### Implementation Requirements
1. **All new pages and components must include translations**
2. **Use the useTranslation hook in client components**
3. **Browser language is auto-detected, with cookie persistence**
4. **Language switcher must be available on all public pages**

### Quick i18n Implementation
```typescript
// Client Component
import { useTranslation } from '@/app/i18n/client'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation('common')
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
}
```

### Translation File Structure
```
app/i18n/locales/
â”œâ”€â”€ en/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common.json    # Shared UI elements
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.json      # Authentication pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard.json # Dashboard content
â”œâ”€â”€ pt/                # Portuguese translations
â””â”€â”€ es/                # Spanish translations
```

**Note for AI Assistants**: When working on this project, prioritize maintaining the existing structure and patterns. Always run tests after making changes. The connector system is the core of the application - handle with care. **All user-facing pages must support internationalization.**
