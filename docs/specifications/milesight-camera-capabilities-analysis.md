# Milesight Fisheye Camera - Complete Capabilities Analysis

## 📷 Camera Overview

The Milesight fisheye cameras are professional-grade surveillance cameras with built-in analytics designed for retail environments. Based on the user manual analysis, here's what these cameras can ACTUALLY do:

## ✅ Confirmed Built-in Capabilities

### 1. **People Counting System**
- **Bidirectional Counting**: Tracks In/Out separately
- **Up to 4 Counting Lines**: Each line can be configured independently
- **Real-time Display**: Shows counts on video overlay (OSD)
- **Threshold Alarms**: Triggers when count exceeds 1-9999
- **Data Export**: CSV format with timestamps
- **Accuracy**: Depends on mounting height and line positioning

### 2. **Regional/Zone Analytics**
- **Up to 8 Regional Views**: Each with independent settings
- **255 Presets per Region**: For detailed monitoring
- **Auto-tracking**: Follows objects within regions (ceiling mount only)
- **Virtual PTZ**: Digital zoom and pan within fisheye view

### 3. **Heat Map Generation**
Two distinct types:
- **Space Heat Map**:
  - Visual PNG image showing density
  - Color-coded activity levels
  - Manual or auto-export (model dependent)
  - Shows cumulative activity over time
  
- **Time Heat Map**:
  - CSV data format
  - Temporal activity patterns
  - Hourly/daily/weekly analysis
  - Can be graphed externally

### 4. **Video Content Analysis (VCA) Events**
Built-in detection for:
- **Region Entrance/Exit**: Detects when objects enter/leave zones
- **Line Crossing**: Directional detection (A→B, B→A, Both)
- **Loitering Detection**: 3-1800 seconds dwell time
- **Advanced Motion Detection**: More accurate than basic MD
- **Human Detection**: AI models only, distinguishes humans from objects
- **Object Left/Removed**: Security applications

### 5. **Alert & Notification System**
Multiple notification methods:
- **Email**: With attached video/images
- **HTTP Notification**: POST/GET to external servers
- **Alarm Output**: Physical relay connections
- **SIP Phone**: Voice calling capability
- **Mobile Push**: Via Milesight app
- **SNMP Traps**: For network monitoring

### 6. **Data Access Methods**
- **Web Interface**: Manual downloads
- **FTP Upload**: Scheduled exports
- **Email Export**: Automated reports
- **Local Storage**: SD card or NAS
- **HTTP Notifications**: Event-based data push

## ❌ NOT Available (Contrary to Earlier Assumptions)

### 1. **No REST API**
- No programmatic real-time data access
- Integration limited to HTTP notifications
- Must parse exported CSV files

### 2. **No Demographics**
- No age detection
- No gender classification
- No facial recognition

### 3. **No Object Classification**
- Cannot identify shopping carts
- Cannot distinguish staff from customers
- Only human vs non-human (AI models)

### 4. **No Queue Analytics**
- Must be calculated from zone data
- No dedicated queue management

### 5. **No Direct Multi-Camera Coordination**
- Each camera operates independently
- Coordination must be done at VMS level
