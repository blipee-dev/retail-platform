# Analytics Aggregation Fix Summary - 2025-07-25

## Overview
Fixed critical issues in the analytics aggregation pipeline that were preventing hourly and daily analytics from being properly populated in Supabase.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys
**Problem**: Aggregation scripts had hardcoded Supabase API keys that were invalid.
**Solution**: Updated scripts to use environment variables from GitHub Secrets.

### 2. Missing Timestamp Fields
**Problem**: `start_time` and `end_time` columns were null in aggregated data.
**Solution**: Added these fields to both hourly and daily aggregation scripts.

### 3. Column Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Daily aggregation script used wrong column names (e.g., `store_entries` instead of `total_entries`).
**Solution**: Created `run_daily_aggregation_fixed.js` with all correct column mappings including:
- Core metrics: `total_entries`, `total_exits`
- Passerby metrics: `passerby_count`, `passerby_in`, `passerby_out`
- Zone analytics: `zone1_share_pct` through `zone4_share_pct`
- Line percentages: `entry_line1_pct` through `exit_line3_pct`
- Business hours metrics
- Peak hour tracking

### 4. Daily Aggregation Not in Main Pipeline
**Problem**: Daily aggregation required manual triggering.
**Solution**: Integrated daily aggregation into `run-analytics-aggregation-v2.yml` to run automatically during midnight window (00:00-02:59 UTC).

## Files Created/Modified

### Scripts Created
- `scripts/run_daily_aggregation_fixed.js` - Fixed daily aggregation with correct columns
- `scripts/debug/verify-inserts.js` - Verify data is being inserted
- `scripts/debug/delete-all-daily-analytics.sql` - Clear table for testing
- `scripts/debug/delete-daily-analytics-20250724.sql` - Delete specific date
- `scripts/debug/list-all-daily-analytics-columns.sql` - List table structure

### Workflows Modified
- `.github/workflows/run-analytics-aggregation-v2.yml` - Added daily aggregation logic

### Scripts Modified
- `scripts/run_hourly_aggregation.js` - Fixed API keys and added timestamps
- `scripts/run_daily_aggregation.js` - Added error logging

## Testing and Verification

### To Test the Fixed Pipeline
1. Clear existing data (if needed):
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE daily_analytics;
   ```

2. Run the aggregation workflow:
   - Manually trigger "Run Analytics Aggregation V2" from GitHub Actions
   - Or wait for the main pipeline to run (every 30 minutes)

3. Verify results:
   ```sql
   SELECT date, store_name, total_entries, total_exits, passerby_count, capture_rate
   FROM daily_analytics
   ORDER BY date DESC;
   ```

## Project Organization
Also ran housekeeping script to organize 50+ debug and test scripts into logical subdirectories:
- `scripts/archive/` - Old versions
- `scripts/debug/data/` - Data debugging
- `scripts/debug/workflow/` - Workflow debugging
- `scripts/migrations/` - SQL files
- `scripts/data-collection/` - Collection scripts
- `scripts/analysis/` - Analysis tools

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the midnight window runs to ensure daily aggregation works automatically
2. Consider adding alerts for aggregation failures
3. Add data quality checks to verify aggregation accuracy

## Impact
- Analytics dashboards will now show accurate hourly and daily data
- No more manual intervention needed for daily aggregation
- Better debugging capabilities for future issues
