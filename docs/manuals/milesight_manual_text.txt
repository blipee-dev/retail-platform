network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is an abbreviation of local area network. VLANs
allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not on the same network
switch. This can greatly simplify network design and deployment, because VLAN membership can
be configured through software. Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs
necessitates the labour of relocating nodes or rewiring data links.
Note: How to set up VLAN in switches, please refers to your switches user manual.
PPPoE
This camera supports the PPPoE auto dial-up function. The camera gets a public IP address by ADSL
dial-up after the camera is connected to a modem. You need to configure the PPPoE parameters of
the network camera.
Note:

--- Page 68 ---
Milesight Fisheye Network Camera User Manual  | 5 - System Operation Guide  | 68
•The obtained IP address is dynamically assigned via PPPoE, so the IP address always changes
after rebooting the camera. To solve the inconvenience of the dynamic IP, you need to get a
domain name from the DDNS provider (e.g. DynDns.com).
•The user name and password should be assigned by your ISP.
SNMP
You can set the SNMP function to get camera status, parameters and alarm related information and
manage the camera remotely when it is connected to the network.
Before setting the SNMP, please download the SNMP software and manage to receive the camera
information via SNMP port. By setting the Trap Address, the camera can send the alarm event and
exception messages to the surveillance center.

Bonjour
Bonjour is based on Apple's multicast DNS service. Bonjour devices can automatically broadcast
their service information and listen to the service information of other devices.
If you don't know the camera information, you can use the Bonjour service on the same LAN to
search for network camera devices and then to access the devices.
RTMP
Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) was initially a proprietary protocol for streaming audio,
video and data over the Internet, between a Flash player and a server. RTMP is a TCP-based protocol
which maintains persistent connections and allows low-latency communication. It can realize the
function of live broadcast so that customers can log in to the camera wherever there is a network.

--- Page 71 ---
Milesight Fisheye Network Camera User Manual  | 5 - System Operation Guide  | 71
For more information, please refer to Troubleshooting-How to Use RTMP for Live Broadcast
Note:
•For YouTube live broadcast, if you use a newly created account to live broadcast, you need to
wait for 24hrs to activate the account for using live function.
•For RTMP, since G.711 is not available for YouTube, so you can only play video from
Milesight network cameras  with H.264 video coding and AAC audio coding on YouTube.
•Server Address in Network Camera RTMP interface needs to be filled with the format: rtmp://<
Server URL >/< Stream key >, remember it needs ’/’to connect between < Server URL > and <
Stream key >.

HTTP NotificationSupport to pop up the alarm news to specified HTTP URL.
Note:
•Three HTTP notifications at most can be added to the same event.
•HTTP Notification supports Basic & Digest authentication
Note: The HTTP notification  function is just one way for camera to send messages to VMS
Software. And it's the VMS that defines what the messages mean and decides what to do after

--- Page 95 ---
Milesight Fisheye Network Camera User Manual  | 5 - System Operation Guide  | 95
receiving this kind of messages. So, we can use the HTTP Notification  function of our cameras only
if the VMS supports this kind of message format.
Here will take the Digifort as an example to introduce the HTTP Notification  function.
The following are the detail steps of setting for HTTP Notification in Digifort VMS and our cameras.
Step1: Enable Alarm, set Motion Region and detection Schedule;
Step2: Check the HTTP Notification as Alarm Action, and fill the fields. Then save the alarm setting.
You can add up to three HTTP notifications to the same event;
HTTP User Name: admin (the user name of your camera)
HTTP Password: ms1234 (the password of your camera)
HTTP Notification URL:
http://IP:8601/Interface/Cameras/MotionDetection/Notify?Camera=CameraName
IP refers to the PC's IP where the Digifort installed.
8601 is the port for Motion signal in Digifort.
CameraName  is the camera name you set in Digifort VMS, like the picture shown below.

--- Page 96 ---
Milesight Fisheye Network Camera User Manual  | 5 - System Operation Guide  | 96
Example:
http://192.168.8.75:8601/Interface/Cameras/MotionDetection/Notify?Camera=annie ,
this URL format is exactly supported by Digifort VMS, so we can set as above to our cameras
and get it work well.
Step3: choose use motion detection by external notification;
Step4: If successful, you can see the device icon turns yellow in the Surveillance when the camera is
under Motion Detection Alarm;

--- Page 97 ---
Milesight Fisheye Network Camera User Manual  | 5 - System Operation Guide  | 97
So, it's the VMS Software which decides whether we can use this function successfully.
Step5: Set alarm settings.
