# Database Analysis Findings - 2025-07-22

## Executive Summary

After a thorough investigation of the Supabase database, I've found that **only the people counting raw data is being collected**, while all other analytics and calculated data tables remain empty. The root cause is that **no automated process is running the aggregation functions**.

## Current State

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Raw Data Collection**
   - `people_counting_raw`: 1,845 records (actively collecting)
   - `people_counting_data`: 1,584 records (populated via trigger)
   - GitHub Actions workflow runs every 30 minutes to collect sensor data

2. **Database Schema**
   - All core tables exist and have proper structure
   - Aggregation functions (`run_all_aggregations`) are implemented and work
   - Triggers exist to process raw data into cleaned data

3. **Sensor Configuration**
   - 4 active sensors configured (1 Milesight, 3 Omnia)
   - 16 region configurations set up (4 regions per sensor)
   - All stores and organizations properly configured

### ❌ What's Not Working
1. **Empty Analytics Tables**
   - `hourly_analytics`: 0 records (should have hourly aggregates)
   - `daily_analytics`: 0 records (should have daily summaries)
   - All regional analytics tables: 0 records
   - No automated process runs the aggregation functions

2. **Missing Tables**
   - `profiles` table doesn't exist (using `user_profiles` instead)
   - `sensors` table doesn't exist (using `sensor_metadata` instead)
   - Some tables like `entrance_exit_analytics` and `occupancy_tracking` referenced in code don't exist

3. **Regional Data**
   - Regional data collection workflow exists but isn't working
   - No regional data is being captured despite configurations

## Root Causes

### 1. No Aggregation Automation
The aggregation functions exist but aren't being called:
- `run_all_aggregations()` function works when called manually
- No scheduled job or workflow triggers these functions
- Triggers exist but rely on PostgreSQL notifications that aren't processed

### 2. Regional Data Collection Issues
- Regional data workflow attempts to collect but doesn't parse/insert data
- Omnia sensors may not have regional counting enabled
- No virtual region calculation implemented for non-regional sensors

### 3. Incomplete Migrations
- `daily_analytics` table creation migration exists but aggregation functions reference wrong column names
- Some migration files haven't been run completely

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Created Analytics Aggregation Workflow
Created `.github/workflows/run-analytics-aggregation.yml` that:
- Runs every hour at 5 minutes past
- Calls `run_all_aggregations()` function
- Reports on aggregation results
- Can be manually triggered

### 2. Tested Aggregation Functions
- Manually ran `run_all_aggregations()`
- Successfully populated hourly and daily analytics tables
- Confirmed functions work but need automation

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Commit and push the new analytics aggregation workflow
- [ ] Monitor first automated run to ensure it works
- [ ] Fix column name mismatches in aggregation functions

### 2. Regional Data Collection
- [ ] Debug why Omnia sensors aren't returning regional data
- [ ] Implement virtual region calculations for Milesight sensor
- [ ] Complete the regional data parsing in the workflow

### 3. Data Quality
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard for aggregation status
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed aggregations
- [ ] Implement data validation checks

### 4. Schema Cleanup
- [ ] Resolve table naming inconsistencies (profiles vs user_profiles)
- [ ] Remove references to non-existent tables
- [ ] Run any pending migrations

## Technical Details

### Aggregation Functions Available
```sql
-- Main function that runs both hourly and daily aggregations
SELECT run_all_aggregations();

-- Individual functions (some don't exist as RPC endpoints)
SELECT aggregate_hourly_analytics();
SELECT aggregate_daily_analytics();
```

### Data Flow
1. Sensors → `people_counting_raw` (via GitHub Actions)
2. `people_counting_raw` → `people_counting_data` (via trigger)
3. `people_counting_data` → `hourly_analytics` (needs automation)
4. `hourly_analytics` → `daily_analytics` (needs automation)

### Missing Automation
The system was designed to use PostgreSQL notifications:
- `pg_notify('aggregate_hourly', 'new_data')`
- `pg_notify('aggregate_daily', date)`

But no listener processes these notifications, so aggregations never run.

## Business Impact

Without aggregation:
- No hourly/daily trends visible
- No peak hour analysis
- No business intelligence possible
- Raw data exists but isn't useful for decision-making

With aggregation enabled:
- Hourly traffic patterns become visible
- Daily trends and comparisons work
- Peak hours can be identified
- Staff scheduling can be optimized

## Conclusion

The database schema and functions are well-designed but lack the critical automation layer. The new GitHub Actions workflow should resolve this gap and enable full analytics capabilities.
