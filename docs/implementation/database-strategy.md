# Database Strategy: MVP vs Future-Proof

## Recommendation: Build Multi-Tenancy Right From the Start âœ…

### Why Multi-Tenancy Must Be Done Properly from Day 1

1. **Retrofitting is Extremely Difficult**
   - Adding tenant isolation after launch requires migrating ALL data
   - Risk of data leakage during migration
   - Requires rewriting most queries and APIs
   - Can cause significant downtime

2. **Security Cannot Be an Afterthought**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies must be comprehensive
   - One mistake = data breach between customers
   - Proper testing requires the full structure

3. **Core Architecture Decisions**
   - Multi-tenancy affects EVERY table
   - URL structure (subdomains/slugs) needs to be decided early
   - API design depends on tenant context

## What to Build Now vs Later

### ðŸš€ Build Now (Essential for Multi-Tenant MVP)

```sql
-- These are NON-NEGOTIABLE for multi-tenancy
- organizations table
- organization_id on ALL tables  
- RLS policies for tenant isolation
- User-organization relationships
- Tenant-aware authentication flow
- Basic audit logging (for compliance)
```

### ðŸ“‹ Can Defer (Nice-to-haves)

```sql
-- These can be added incrementally
- Advanced permissions/custom roles
- Billing/subscription details
- Usage tracking tables
- Advanced audit features
- API rate limiting per tenant
- Backup/restore per tenant
```

## Recommended Schema Approach

### 1. Core Tables (Build Now)
```sql
-- Minimal but complete structure
organizations
â”œâ”€â”€ id, name, slug
â”œâ”€â”€ created_at, updated_at
â””â”€â”€ settings (JSONB for flexibility)

user_profiles  
â”œâ”€â”€ id, organization_id (REQUIRED)
â”œâ”€â”€ role (6 fixed roles)
â””â”€â”€ basic profile fields

stores
â”œâ”€â”€ id, organization_id (REQUIRED)
â”œâ”€â”€ region_id (can be nullable initially)
â””â”€â”€ core fields only

-- Every table MUST have organization_id
```

### 2. Flexibility for Future
```sql
-- Use JSONB for extensibility
settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}'     -- Add features without migrations
metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'     -- Store custom fields
permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}'  -- Future permission system
```

### 3. Start Simple, But Correct
```sql
-- Simple RLS that's still secure
CREATE POLICY "Tenant isolation" ON table_name
FOR ALL USING (
    organization_id = current_user_organization_id()
);
```

## Migration Strategy

### If You Start Without Multi-Tenancy:
1. **Month 1-3**: Single tenant works fine
2. **Month 4**: Need second customer = PANIC
3. **Month 5-6**: Major refactoring while maintaining service
4. **Risk**: Downtime, bugs, security issues

### If You Start With Multi-Tenancy:
1. **Month 1**: Slightly more initial setup
2. **Month 2+**: Just works for any number of tenants
3. **Benefit**: Sleep well knowing it scales

## The Practical MVP Schema

Here's what I recommend for your MVP - properly structured but not over-engineered:

```sql
-- 1. Start with proper structure
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    -- Skip complex billing for MVP
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- 2. Every table has org_id
CREATE TABLE stores (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- Only essential fields for MVP
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- 3. Simple but correct RLS
ALTER TABLE stores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Org isolation" ON stores
    FOR ALL USING (organization_id = auth.organization_id());

-- 4. Extensible for future
ALTER TABLE organizations 
    ADD COLUMN settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
-- Can add {"features": ["advanced_analytics"]} without migration
```

## Decision Matrix

| Aspect | Quick MVP | Proper Multi-Tenant | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Initial Dev Time | 2 weeks | 3 weeks | +1 week is worth it |
| Adding 2nd Tenant | 2-3 months | 0 days | Critical difference |
| Security Risk | High | Low | Non-negotiable |
| Technical Debt | Massive | Minimal | Avoid the pain |
| Customer Trust | "Can you isolate our data?" | "Yes, from day 1" | Sell with confidence |

## Conclusion

**Build multi-tenancy properly from the start.** The extra week of initial development will save you months of pain and risk later. However, keep the schema simple within that proper structure - use JSONB fields for flexibility and only add complex features when actually needed.

Remember: You can always add features to a well-structured database, but restructuring a poorly designed one with live customer data is a nightmare.
