## 🟢 Recently Fixed

### 1. Analytics Aggregation Pipeline (July 25, 2025)
- **Status**: ✅ Completely Fixed
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Hardcoded API keys in aggregation scripts
  - Missing timestamp fields (start_time, end_time)
  - Column name mismatches in daily_analytics table
  - Daily aggregation requiring manual triggers
- **Solutions**:
  - Updated scripts to use environment variables
  - Added proper timestamp fields to aggregations
  - Created `run_daily_aggregation_fixed.js` with correct column mappings
  - Integrated daily aggregation into main pipeline (midnight window)
- **Result**: Both hourly and daily analytics now fully automated

### 2. Database Schema Optimization (July 23, 2025)
- **Status**: ✅ Optimized
- **Issue**: 34 tables with duplicates and unused features causing confusion
- **Solution**: Reduced to 11 essential tables with clear purposes
- **Result**: 68% reduction in complexity, improved performance
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed 23 unused/duplicate tables
  - Added sensor health monitoring capabilities
  - Fixed NULL sensor_id issues
  - Implemented audit trail for changes

### 3. Hourly Analytics Aggregation
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and Enhanced
- **Issue**: Missing fields and hardcoded credentials
- **Solution**: Updated scripts with environment variables and all required fields
- **Result**: Successfully aggregating data every hour with proper timestamps

### 4. Regional Data Collection
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed
- **Issue**: Wrong table name and sensor IDs
- **Solution**: Updated to use `regional_counting_raw` table with correct sensor IDs
- **Result**: Successfully collecting regional data

## 📊 Data Flow Summary

```
Sensors → Raw Data Tables → Analytics Tables → API → Dashboard
   ↓           ↓                    ↓
OML01-PC   people_counting_raw   hourly_analytics
OML02-PC   regional_counting_raw  daily_analytics
OML03-PC        ↓
J&J-ARR-01-PC   11 optimized tables (from 34)
```

### Optimized Table Structure:
- **Core**: organizations, stores, sensor_metadata, user_profiles
- **Data**: people_counting_raw, regional_counting_raw
- **Analytics**: hourly_analytics, daily_analytics
- **Config**: region_configurations, alerts, latest_sensor_data

## 📝 Scripts Created

### Utility Scripts
1. **verify_data_pipeline.py** - Comprehensive pipeline verification
2. **upload_regional_data_24h.js** - Manual upload of historical regional data
3. **setup_regional_configurations.py** - Configure regions for sensors
4. **run_hourly_aggregation.js** - Hourly analytics aggregation (FIXED)
5. **run_daily_aggregation_fixed.js** - Daily analytics with correct column mappings (NEW)

### Test Scripts
1. **test_regional_collection.js** - Test regional data collection
2. **verify-inserts.js** - Verify data insertion to Supabase (NEW)

### Debug Scripts
1. **delete-all-daily-analytics.sql** - Clear daily data for testing (NEW)
2. **list-all-daily-analytics-columns.sql** - List table structure (NEW)

## ✅ Verified Working

1. **Sensor Connectivity**: All 4 sensors are accessible
2. **Data Collection**: Both people counting and regional data are being collected
3. **Database Storage**: Data is being stored correctly
4. **Region Setup**: All regions are properly configured

## 🔴 Needs Attention

1. ~~**Create daily analytics aggregation**~~ - ✅ FIXED (July 25, 2025)
2. **Update API endpoints** - Ensure they work with current data structure
3. **Add occupancy calculations** - Currently set to 0 in hourly analytics
4. **Regional data staleness** - Check why regional data collection seems delayed
5. **Real-time WebSocket updates** - For live dashboard data

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ~~Create a daily analytics aggregation script~~ - ✅ DONE
2. Test all API endpoints for data retrieval
3. Implement proper occupancy calculations
4. Set up monitoring for workflow failures
5. Connect live data to dashboard components
6. Implement real-time updates (WebSocket/SSE)
7. Add heat map visualizations

## 📌 Important Notes

- The `regional_analytics` table is for aggregated data with time buckets, not raw data
- Use `regional_counting_raw` for raw regional sensor data
- The `hourly_analytics` table has many columns that may not all be used
- All timestamps are stored in UTC in the database
